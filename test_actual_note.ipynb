PMH significant for COPD, Crohn&apos;s disease, chronic back pain, and 3PPD smoker. Presented to ED on 2/7/2015 after a fall 4 days earlier. Patient states he had been using a cane and walker for ambulation due to chronic back pain and fell backwards and was unable to move because of pain. States he was unable to walk after the fall. In ED patient was found to be tachycardic with oxygen sats of 93% on RA. Labs were significant for leukocytosis. CXR showed diffuse interstitial and patchy airspace opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Initial blood cultures (drawn 02/07) grew MRSA (discussed below) and due to concomitant back pain and an L1 fracture (discussed below), an MRI of his spine was ordered to rule out osteomyelitis. The MRI was negative for any osteomyelitis. A CT scan of his chest on 02/10 was obtained and showed a right pleural effusion with areas of loculation. CT surgery was consulted and felt he did not need acute intervention at that time. They recommended outpatient follow up in 4-6 weeks (from 02/10). Patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics that were refined as cultures returned. His antibiotic regimen was refined to intravenous Vancomycin (end date: 03/08), oral Clindamycin (end date:02/27) and oral Cefuroxime (end date:02/27).  The patient showed gradual improvement in his respiratory status, being weaned off supplemental O2 on 02/11. His leukocytosis also saw gradual improvement. A repeat CT scan of his chest on 02/17 showed resolution of his pleural effusions and improving multifocal pneumonia. Additional ED XR showed displaced left femoral neck fracture. Patient was taken to the OR for left hip hemiarthroplasty on (02/16) with Dr. Wilson. XR also showed acute L1 fracture. Neurosurgery was consulted and did not feel that patient  needed surgical intervention at this time and patient was placed in a TLSO and will f/u as an outpatient. Pain management was consulted due to difficulty achieving pain control and their recommendations are listed. Patient received therapy while in acute, however deficits persisted. Deficits are: Pain;Decreased strength;Impaired ADLs;Impaired balance;Impaired activity tolerance;Impaired functional mobility;Impaired bed mobility;Impaired ability to transfer (&lt; ambulation). Patient will now be admitted for inpatient rehab for intensive therapy and continuation of medical care.   Subjective:   Interval History: Patient seen in room sitting up in wheelchair getting ready to start ADLs with OT.  States he continues to have his same pain.  Denies any new events over the weekend.  Wants to make sure that he has pain medication when he is discharged tomorrow.  States ortho did come up and look at his wound and change the Aquacel dressing yesterday but did not remove any sutures.

       "Rehabilitation Progress Note  LOS: 10 days  3/2/<span style=\"color:red\">2014</span>  Synopsis: <span style=\"color:red\">Karen Amanda Vance</span> is a <span style=\"color:red\">45</span> y.o. male admitted with Impaired Mobility. PMH significant for COPD, Crohn&apos;s disease, chronic back pain, and 3PPD smoker. Presented to ED on <span style=\"color:red\">02/06/2015</span> after a fall 4 days earlier. Patient states he had been using a cane and walker for ambulation due to chronic back pain and fell backwards and was unable to move because of pain. States he was unable to walk after the fall. In ED patient was found to be tachycardic with oxygen sats of 93% on RA. Labs were significant for leukocytosis. CXR showed diffuse interstitial and patchy airspace opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Initial blood cultures (drawn <span style=\"color:red\">02-06</span>) grew MRSA (discussed below) and due to concomitant back pain and an L1 fracture (discussed below), an MRI of his spine was ordered to rule out osteomyelitis. The MRI was negative for any osteomyelitis. A CT scan of his chest on <span style=\"color:red\">02/09</span> was obtained and showed a right pleural effusion with areas of loculation. CT surgery was consulted and felt he did not need acute intervention at that time. They recommended outpatient follow up in 4-6 weeks (from <span style=\"color:red\">02-09</span>). Patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics that were refined as cultures returned. His antibiotic regimen was refined to intravenous Vancomycin (end date: <span style=\"color:red\">Mar 07</span>), oral Clindamycin (end date:<span style=\"color:red\">February 26</span>) and oral Cefuroxime (end date:<span style=\"color:red\">02/26</span>).  The patient showed gradual improvement in his respiratory status, being weaned off supplemental O2 on <span style=\"color:red\">02/10</span>. His leukocytosis also saw gradual improvement. A repeat CT scan of his chest on <span style=\"color:red\">02-16</span> showed resolution of his pleural effusions and improving multifocal pneumonia. Additional ED XR showed displaced left femoral neck fracture. Patient was taken to the OR for left hip hemiarthroplasty on <span style=\"color:red\">(02/16</span>) with Dr. <span style=\"color:red\">Sally</span>. XR also showed acute L1 fracture. Neurosurgery was consulted and did not feel that patient  needed surgical intervention at this time and patient was placed in a TLSO and will f/u as an outpatient. Pain management was consulted due to difficulty achieving pain control and their recommendations are listed. Patient received therapy while in acute, however deficits persisted. Deficits are: Pain;Decreased strength;Impaired ADLs;Impaired balance;Impaired activity tolerance;Impaired functional mobility;Impaired bed mobility;Impaired ability to transfer (&lt; ambulation). Patient will now be admitted for inpatient rehab for intensive therapy and continuation of medical care.   Subjective:   Interval History: Patient seen in room sitting up in wheelchair getting ready to start ADLs with OT.  States he continues to have his same pain.  Denies any new events over the weekend.  Wants to make sure that he has pain medication when he is discharged tomorrow.  States ortho did come up and look at his wound and change the Aquacel dressing yesterday but did not remove any sutures.    Nursing noted over the weekend that patient removed his TLSO for a shower.    Patient reports pain management is <span style=\"color:red\">Melanie Nolan</span>, FNP-BC <span style=\"color:red\">(433)837-6059</span> phone and <span style=\"color:red\">(640)164-7378</span> fax    Review of Systems Denies any headache, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.

Prior to his diagnosis,he had been experiencing recurrent URI&apos;s, rapid weight loss and anemia.   Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed 17% blasts. A p210 BCR/ABL was positive at 0.909.   He was initially treated with Hydrea after admission for intractable pain. He was then started on Gleevec 400mg daily on 04/01/2010.   During this admission, it was also noted that he had significant left-sided neck and shoulder pain, the etiology of which was initially unclear. CT of the chest was obtained on 04/05/2010, revealing no evidence of PE; however, there was a concerning soft tissue density near the clavicle. An MRI revealed a lesion suspicious for osteomyelitis on his left clavicle.   CT Surgery was consulted and an FNA biopsy was obtained revealing a leukocytic infiltration with no blasts, but concern for possible abscess. On 04/16/2010 he had an open biopsy of soft tissue and partial left clavicle resection revealing an osseous chloroma.   Because of persistence of molecular activity on 03/23/2011, he was switched to Tasigna 400 mg BID, but he developed a diffuse rash and this medication was discontinued. He was restarted at 200mg bid, but in 12/2011 he hd a significant increase in his PCR and marked thrombocytosis of 800,000.   He was switched to Sprycel 100 mg qd, which was initially discontinued, but then restarted at lower doses due to progression. Due to intolerance, Sprycel was discontinued and hydrea reinitiated 1/2/13.   He was started on Bosutinib in February 2013 but shortly after beginning this medication, he experienced severe scalp pain, joint pain and rash around his neck and shoulders. He discontinue the medication and after two days, symptoms had begun to subside. He restarted the medication but his symptoms recurred.

He discontinue the medication and after two days, symptoms had begun to subside. He restarted the medication but his symptoms recurred.   He was  tried on pamatinib but had similar if not worse side effects. He was placed back on hydrea, but because of increasing basophilia was again put on Gleevec.   Most recently, Mr. Triplett began an induction course ( BID for 14 days) of omacetaxine on 8/26/13. Unfortunately during 6 cycles of omacetaxine Mr. Triplett continued to evidence gradually increasing WBCs and basophils.   He presented to clinic on 2/24/14 with a WBC 35.9 with 3% blasts in the periphery. In clinic, he complained of extremely low energy level and poor appetite. He had a persistent, unchanged rash on his back. He had not noticed any fevers or chills. He denied unexplained weight loss or gain, headaches, loss of vision, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, lower extremity swelling, change in bowel or bladder habits, bleeding or bruising. Overall his performance status was a 2 with a Karnofsky of 60-70%.   A plan was made for scheduled admission for induction chemotherapy with 7+3 cytarabine/daunorubicin after PAC placement in IR. Of note, he has a PMH significant for ASCVD s/p CABG with a pre-treatment ECHO LVEF of 55-60%.  Following his initial course of therapy with 7 + 3, he had persistent &quot;accelerated phase&quot; disease.    With rapidly increasing WBC, it was elected to begin therapy with CPI 613, mitoxantrone, high dose cytarabine on the Phase I protocol.

See comment. PB: Basophilia and eosinophilia.  Normocytic anemia.  See CBC data. COMMENT:  The bone marrow aspirate smears are aspicular but cellular and adequate for evaluation. There is marked basophilia and eosinophilia. Blasts are not increased in numbers (2% by manual differential counts). Maturing myeloid elements are present. Erythroid precursors are rare. Some eosinophils appear atypical with large purple granules.  Examination of the bone marrow core biopsy reveals a hypercellular marrow for age (90%). CD34 immunohistochemistry highlights scattered blasts, comprising less than 5% of the marrow elements. Myeloid cells comprise the majority of the marrow elements. Megakaryocytes are small, hypolobated and present in clusters. There are no atypical lymphoid aggregates or granulomas identified. Examination of the bone marrow clot section reveals similar findings. A reticulin stain highlights increased myelofibrosis (grade 1 of 3), with focal marked increased.  The peripheral blood leukocytes are morphologically unremarkable.  Overall, the findings are consistent with recurrence of patient&apos; s chronic myeloid leukemia, accelerated phase.  PATHOLOGY: This recently transfused has positive direct antiglobulin test and the eluate made from the patient&apos;s circulating red blood cells is negative with reagent red cells tested.

IMAGING: DI CHEST 1 VIEW PORTABLE, May 04, 2014 05:47:09 PM  CONCLUSION:  Left PICC remains in place.  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette which appears normal.  Scattered linear and slight hazy opacities in the lung bases, with little change when technical differences are taken into account. This reflects residual from a resolved pneumonia or a slow to resolve atypical infection.  XRAY CHEST (FRONTAL AND LATERAL), May 03, 2014 08:20:08 AM CONCLUSION:  No significant interval change in the appearance of the chest with similar scattered airspace opacities most likely reflective of resolving/resolved pneumonia with residual scarring and persistent tiny right pleural effusion. There may be a component of persistent atypical infection.  The left upper extremity PICC remains in similar position with the tip in the right atrium.  DI CHEST PA AND LATERAL, Apr 29, 2014 12:44:42 PM CONCLUSION:  Similar opacities likely represent resolving pneumonia, with persistent small right pleural effusion.  Left upper extremity PICC in satisfactory position.  Chest xray (4/22) CONCLUSION: 1. Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.   2. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities consistent with pneumonia.   3. Interval removal of the right IJ approach port with placement of a PICC.  Chest xray (4/15) CONCLUSION:  Similar bilateral ill-defined opacities consistent with resolving pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions, with some mild increase in the size of right pleural effusion.

There may be a component of persistent atypical infection.  The left upper extremity PICC remains in similar position with the tip in the right atrium.  DI CHEST PA AND LATERAL, Apr 29, 2014 12:44:42 PM CONCLUSION:  Similar opacities likely represent resolving pneumonia, with persistent small right pleural effusion.  Left upper extremity PICC in satisfactory position.  Chest xray (4/22) CONCLUSION: 1. Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.   2. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities consistent with pneumonia.   3. Interval removal of the right IJ approach port with placement of a PICC.  Chest xray (4/15) CONCLUSION:  Similar bilateral ill-defined opacities consistent with resolving pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions, with some mild increase in the size of right pleural effusion.   CT THORAX WITHOUT CONTRAST, Apr 02, 2014 09:40:58 AM CONCLUSION: 1.Extensive bronchocentric  micronodular,  interstitial thickening, scattered ground glass nodules, including spiculated nodule lingular measuring about 18 mm, consistent with the multilobar pneumonia, including  atypical organism.. 2. Follow up CT is recommended to resolution to rule out a underlying mass lesions .
