Basal Insulin: Lantus  15 units at bedtime     Insulin to Carb Ratios: 1 unit for 20 grams   Correction Scale:  200-250=1 unit; 250-300=2 units; 300-350=3 units   Insulin injections: abdomen      Hypoglycemia: Ashlin reports 1-2 episodes of low blood sugars a week. She states that she is consistently able to recognize these episodes. Her symptoms of hypoglycemia include: feeling shaky, hunger, confusion, r and sweating.  Ashlin has a current glucagon kit and has a medic alert bracelet.   Meal plan: Ashlin has a flexible meal plan and counts carbohydrates.   Exercise: Ashlin is moderately, physically active. Ashlin usually checks a blood sugar before vigorous exercise. This is when she seem to have moe low blood sugars.  Social: Ashlin lives with her parents and 2 sisters. Ashlin is a junior in high school; she is in her school&apos;s version of &quot;early college&quot;. Ashlin will have an associates degree when she graduates from high school  Ashlin is currently in the Promise Program at Davidson County Community College.     Weight today 160.9 lbs and 62&quot;  (last visit  157.6 lbs and 62&quot;)    Blood sugar summary (average of 108 with range from 62-233 with 4-5 checks per day)    I met with Ashlin and her mom and Dawn, to discuss her  type 1 diabetes which was diagnosed on 12/31/13. And her A1c was 8.9%..    Ashlin&apos;s biggest adjustment has been getting used to injections and eating changes.  She &quot;hates shots&quot;, but is doing much better now. We reviewed carb counting and Ashlin said that she is getting more comfortable with the help of her mom.    We did discuss stress and blood sugars.  She experienced a 67 after stress yesterday, although stress usually increases blood sugars. No changes were made since most blood sugars were within target.    Plan:   Return to see Kathie Cooper in 3 months   Call with questions or problems prior to next appointment    Kathleen Cooper, RN, CDE    "

We did discuss stress and blood sugars.  She experienced a 67 after stress yesterday, although stress usually increases blood sugars.
